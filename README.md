# Description
Serverless AWS Functions (Lambda) Nodejs, Serverless, webpack and DynamoDB

# Technology Stack

**The main technology stack is:**

#### [Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm)](https://nodejs.org/)
Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

#### [Serverless (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless)
Build applications comprised of microservices that run in response to events, auto-scale for you, and only charge you when they run.

#### [DynamoDb (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk)
Provides a JavaScript API for AWS services. You can use the JavaScript API to build libraries or applications for Node.js

#### [Webpack (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)
Is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

**Additionally, the following libraries are used**

#### [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
